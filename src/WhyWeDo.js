      <h1>Why and What We Do</h1>
      <p>
      More than 70 million people around the world use sign language to communicate. 
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      In a world filled with voices, silence carries a profound meaning. But silence 
      should never equate to a lack of communication. Eloquent was designed to bridge 
      the gap between silence and sound, gestures and words, using cutting-edge technology.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      With Eloquent's real-time object detection machine learning software, we recognize 
      hand signs and translate them into segmented words in an instant. We're not merely 
      facilitating conversation; we're igniting understanding, fostering inclusivity, and 
      empowering a community often left unheard. 
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      Eloquent isn't just a product; it's a movement towards a world where communication 
      knows no bounds, and every sign is a symbol of connection.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      Join us today and fight for change.
